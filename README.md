### the second sprint will be for payment as the student pays by fawry or credit card and choose the way of payment and the instructor or teacher can recieve the money on his virtual wallet or to his bank account directly or by debit card

## i will use the fibbonacci series in estimating the story points but with some modifications as ( 1,2,3,5,8,13,20...) and that the story point

## the order of the backlog will be due to their true buissness importance
     as the sprint will take betwwen 2 weeks and 3 weeks 
     as epic 1 will take 97 story point (3 sprints) which is planned
     it took 2 months and half
     and epic 2 will take 90 story point 
     2 months
## Estimate how many story points can your team achieve per sprint
     between 20 and 40
## work flow rationale and rules
     first of all we will have a task then the task will be assigned to ateam or member if it is short then it will be tested then if it passed testing it will be dne if not we      must assign it to the same team or member to fix the issues until it passes the testing phase
